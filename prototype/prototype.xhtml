<ul>
    <li>Prototype
        <ul>
            <li>Every object is linked to a prototype object from which it can inherit properties.
            </li>
            <li> All objects created from object literals are linked to Object.prototype, an object that comes standard
                with JavaScript.
            </li>
            <li>The prototype link has no effect on updating. When we make changes to an object, the object's prototype
                is not touched.
            </li>
            <li>The prototype link is used only in retrieval. If we try to retrieve a property value from an object, and
                if the object lacks the property name, then JavaScript attempts to retrieve the property value from the
                prototype object.
            </li>
            <li>The prototype relationship is a dynamic relationship. If we add a new property to a prototype, that
                property will immediately be visible in all of the objects that are based on that prototype.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
