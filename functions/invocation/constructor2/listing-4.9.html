<ul>
    <li>Invocation as a constructor
        <ul>
            <li>If the constructor returns an object, that object is returned as the value of the whole new expression,
                and the newly constructed object passed as this to the constructor is discarded.
            </li>
            <li>If, however, a nonobject is returned from the constructor, the returned value is ignored, and the newly
                created object is returned.
            </li>
