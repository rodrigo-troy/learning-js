    callbacks
</p>

<p>
    What’s especially important about this code is that it uses a single anonymous function, placed as a setInterval
    argument, to accomplish the animation of the target div element. That function accesses three variables: elem, tick,
    and timer, via a closure, to control the animation process. The three variables (the reference to the DOM element,
    elem; the tick counter, tick; and the timer reference, timer) all must be maintained across the steps of the
    animation. And we need to keep them out of the global scope.
</p>
<p>
    But the example will still work fine if we move the variables out of the animateIt function and into the global
    scope. So why all the arm flailing about not polluting the global scope?
</p>
<p>
    The problem immediately becomes obvious. If we keep the variables in the global scope, we need a set of three
    variables for each animation. Otherwise, they’ll step all over each other, trying to use the same set of variables
    to keep track of multiple states.
</p>
<p>
    By defining the variables inside the function, and by relying on closures to make them available to the timer
    callback invocations, each animation gets its own private “bubble” of variables, as shown in figure.

<p>
    There’s another important concept that this example makes clear. Not only can we see the values that these variables
    had at the time the closure was created, but we can update them within the closure while the function within the
    closure executes. <span style="font-weight: bold;color: coral">The closure isn’t just a snapshot of the state of the scope at the time of creation, but an active
    encapsulation of that state that we can modify as long as the closure exists</span>.
